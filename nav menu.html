        <h1>Welcome to Web Development</h1>
        <p>Web development is a broad term that encompasses all aspects of creating a website. It includes everything from creating a simple static page to complex web applications.</p>
        
        <p>There are two main categories of web development: front-end and back-end. Front-end development focuses on what users see and interact with, including the layout, design, and behavior of a website. Technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are essential for front-end development.</p>
        
        <p>Back-end development, on the other hand, deals with the server-side of applications. It involves managing databases, server configuration, and application logic. Common back-end languages include PHP, Python, Ruby, and Node.js.</p>
        
        <p>With the rise of web frameworks and libraries, developers can create responsive, dynamic web applications more efficiently. Frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js for front-end and Express.js, Django, and Ruby on Rails for back-end are popular choices among developers today.</p>
        
        <p>As technology evolves, web development continues to grow, offering exciting opportunities for developers to create innovative solutions and improve user experiences.</p>
